It notes that house prices in Dublin are still nearly 40 per cent lower than their 2007 peak when the Celtic Tiger was still roaring. Apartments in the capital are still around 46 per cent lower than in the boom times. </p> <p>Nationally the CSO said residential properties in all other parts of Ireland are 45 per cent lower than in 2007. </p> </blockquote> <p>Those with long memories, though, may worry, Henry concludes:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It was the nation’s obsession with rising property prices that fuelled an overheated market, prompting speculators and builders to borrow billions from Irish banks that in large part helped bust the Irish economy. </p> </blockquote> </div>
